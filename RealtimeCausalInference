Causal Adaptive Neural System is Durai Rajamanickam's novel method for real time causal inference. 

Real-time causal inference in dynamic environments is a significant
challenge in machine learning, particularly in domains such as health-
care, finance, and law. We introduce the Causal Adaptive Neural
System (CANS), a novel framework that integrates external knowledge
from knowledge graphs with adaptive learning mechanisms to perform
real-time causal inference. CANS leverages a neural antenna mechanism
for dynamic knowledge retrieval, an adaptive causal graph for modeling
and updating causal relationships, and efficient computational methods
inspired by Ramanujan’s mathematical techniques to optimize iterative
computations in Bayesian updates and counterfactual reasoning. We ad-
dress potential challenges in implementation complexity, knowledge qual-
ity, explainability, scalability, and ethical considerations. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, convergence
speed, and computational efficiency compared to existing methods, high-
lighting CANS’s potential for practical deployment across multiple do-
mains.
